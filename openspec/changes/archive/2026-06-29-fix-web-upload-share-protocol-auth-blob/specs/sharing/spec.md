- **THEN** the system SHALL return only shares owned by that user with status and pagination metadata

#### Scenario: Owner share request omits bearer token
- **WHEN** a client calls an owner share management API without the owner's bearer access token
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject the request as unauthenticated

#### Scenario: Owner cancels share
- **WHEN** an owner cancels one or more shares with a valid bearer access token
- **THEN** the system SHALL mark those shares unavailable for future access

### Requirement: Download Shared Content
The system SHALL allow visitors with valid share tokens and download permission to download shared files using the binary download contract.

#### Scenario: Visitor downloads shared file
- **WHEN** a visitor requests a shared file with a valid share token and download permission
- **THEN** the system SHALL return the file content using the download contract

#### Scenario: Share is cancelled after token issue
- **WHEN** a share is cancelled or expires after a token was issued
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject browse and download requests for that share

#### Scenario: Visitor download uses owner token instead of share token
- **WHEN** a visitor shared-file download request provides an owner bearer token but no valid share token
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject the request as outside the visitor share access domain
