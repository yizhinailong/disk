# File Transfer Specification

## Purpose

Defines upload, upload accounting, resumable chunk transfer, instant upload, completion, cancellation, and ranged download behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Upload Initialization
The system SHALL initialize file uploads by validating the target folder, filename, file size, file hash, and user storage availability.

#### Scenario: New upload is initialized
- **WHEN** an authenticated user initializes an upload with valid metadata and sufficient storage
- **THEN** the system SHALL create an upload task and return upload instructions including chunk information

#### Scenario: Upload cannot be initialized
- **WHEN** the upload metadata is invalid, target folder is inaccessible, or storage is insufficient
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject initialization without creating an active upload task

### Requirement: Upload Storage Reservation
The system SHALL reserve user storage during upload initialization and SHALL release or convert that reservation during upload cancellation, expiry, or completion.

#### Scenario: Upload initialized with reservation
- **WHEN** a non-instant upload is initialized
- **THEN** the system SHALL increase reserved storage by the upload size

#### Scenario: Upload completed
- **WHEN** an upload completes successfully
- **THEN** the system SHALL convert reserved storage into used storage atomically

#### Scenario: Upload cancelled or expired
- **WHEN** an upload is cancelled or expires before completion
- **THEN** the system SHALL release the reserved storage

### Requirement: Instant Upload
The system SHALL support instant upload when uploaded content already exists and can be referenced safely.

#### Scenario: Existing content matches upload hash
- **WHEN** upload initialization finds existing content matching the requested file hash
- **THEN** the system SHALL create file metadata referencing the existing content without requiring chunk upload

### Requirement: Resumable Chunk Upload
The system SHALL support chunked and resumable upload using upload task state and uploaded chunk tracking.

#### Scenario: Chunk uploaded successfully
- **WHEN** a client uploads a valid chunk for an active upload task
- **THEN** the system SHALL store the chunk and record the uploaded chunk index

#### Scenario: Client resumes upload
- **WHEN** a client initializes or continues an upload with existing uploaded chunks
- **THEN** the system SHALL expose which chunks are already uploaded so the client can skip them

### Requirement: Upload Completion
The system SHALL complete an upload only after all required chunks are present and the assembled file matches expected integrity checks.

#### Scenario: All chunks are valid
- **WHEN** a client completes an upload with all valid chunks present
- **THEN** the system SHALL assemble the file, create file metadata, update storage accounting, and clean temporary state

#### Scenario: Chunks are missing or invalid
- **WHEN** a client attempts to complete an upload with missing or invalid chunks
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject completion and preserve enough state for retry or cleanup

### Requirement: File Download Metadata
The system SHALL provide download metadata before file content transfer.

#### Scenario: Download info requested
- **WHEN** an authenticated user requests download information for an accessible file
- **THEN** the system SHALL return file metadata needed by the client to download the file

### Requirement: Ranged File Download
The system SHALL support HTTP byte range requests for file downloads, and clients that resume downloads SHALL request byte ranges that match already received content before appending resumed bytes.

#### Scenario: Full download
- **WHEN** a client requests a file without a Range header
- **THEN** the system SHALL return the full file content

#### Scenario: Valid range download
- **WHEN** a client requests a valid byte range
- **THEN** the system SHALL return partial content for the requested range

#### Scenario: Invalid range download
- **WHEN** a client requests an unsatisfiable byte range
- **THEN** the system SHALL reject the request with a range error

#### Scenario: Client resumes from known offset
- **WHEN** a client has already received a prefix of a downloadable file and the file supports range requests
- **THEN** the client SHALL request a byte range beginning at the first missing byte before appending resumed content to the existing bytes

#### Scenario: Resume response cannot be matched
- **WHEN** a client attempts to resume a ranged download and the response does not confirm the requested starting offset
- **THEN** the client SHALL NOT append the response to existing partial bytes
